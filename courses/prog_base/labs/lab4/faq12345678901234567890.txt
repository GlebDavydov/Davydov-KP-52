WELCOME TO STEEL HEROES DUEL SIMULATOR! This FAQ is to guide you through the principals of the game. First of all, you have to build a robot. You have to choose a robot modell, "pattern", (there are five) and two or three (depending on a model) different weapons. Choose wisely. It's useless to arm a slow robot with a melee or arming a berserker-fast platform with sniper guns. You may always try whatever you wish, though. Then, you may start a battle with your friend! (Unfortunatelly the AI opponent is not ready yet. Coming soon). The battle mechanism is turn-based. Your and your opponent's robot are facing each other on a staight line. Starting distance between them is 6. During your turn you may move for as long as you have a speed reserve and use your weapons (each gun might be used once per turn, which gives three-gunned robots a kind of advantage, hovewer they are either slow or poorly armored). The weapons may be used only if the enemy is in range. The real range is twice bigger then range points, for example, turbolaser with range 4 may hit anything not further than 8. Some weapons have range of zero: they are melee ones! Yeah, you may punch and kick your foe here! The other ones have a range below zero. This means they can be fired at any range equal to or below their absolute value but not in melee combat. The weapon makes as many shots as big is its firerate. FR of 4 means 4 rounds at once. Each shot may either hit or miss or deal critical damage. The robot looses HP equal to damage dealt, however, both armor and shields block a part of damage. Armor lowers Splash (physical) Damage and is useless versus Blast (energy) Damage; shields lower both Slpash and Blast Damage, but Blast discharges the shield. The shield recharges for 5 points eachturn, but HP don't regenerate. The robot also loses more HP from physical than from energy damage. The battle continues until one of the robots loses all HP and blows up. The survivor is the winner, what could be easier?
